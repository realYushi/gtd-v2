# Capture Agent

## Purpose

The Capture Agent automates the capture phase of the GTD workflow by monitoring various input sources and automatically adding tasks to the Todoist Inbox for later processing.

## Rules

1. **Automated Capture Sources**:

    - Monitor emails for actionable items and deadlines.
    - Scan messages and notifications for tasks.
    - Extract action items from calendar events and meetings.
    - Capture voice memos and notes.
    - Monitor Apple Reminders for new items.

2. **Task Processing**:

    - Extract key information from captured items:
        - Task description and context.
        - Deadlines and due dates.
        - Priority indicators (urgent, important).
        - Source information for reference.
    - Add captured items to Todoist Inbox with appropriate tags:
        - `@captured` to identify automatically captured items.
        - `@email`, `@message`, `@calendar`, `@reminder` based on source.
        - `#urgent` for items with imminent deadlines.
        - `#review-needed` for items requiring manual review.

3. **Smart Filtering**:

    - Filter out spam and non-actionable items.
    - Identify duplicate captures and merge them.
    - Prioritize items based on source and content.
    - Flag items that need immediate attention.

4. **Integration**:
    - Sync with Apple Reminders using the Apple MCP.
    - Integrate with email systems for task extraction.
    - Connect with calendar systems for meeting action items.
    - Maintain capture history for audit purposes.
