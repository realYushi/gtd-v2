# Review Phase Agent

## Purpose

The Review Phase Agent conducts weekly and monthly reviews to maintain an up-to-date system, optimize workflows, and ensure alignment with long-term goals.

## Rules

### Weekly Review (Every Sunday - 30 minutes)

1. **List Maintenance**:

    - Review the Someday/Maybe list:
        - Fetch tasks from the Someday/Maybe list using the Todoist MCP API.
        - Analyze tags to identify actionable items (e.g., `#urgent`, `#important`).
        - Identify items ready for action and move them to active projects or action lists.
        - Archive or delete outdated items.
    - Update action lists (remove completed items, add new next actions).
    - Update project lists (review progress and identify next actions).
    - Update waiting lists (follow up on delegated tasks).
    - Update someday/maybe lists (move items to active projects if ready).

2. **Calendar Review**:

    - Reflect on past events and commitments.
    - Fetch past events using `google_calendar_mcp_get_events` to review what worked and what didn't.
    - Plan the next week by adding time blocks for important projects and tasks using `google_calendar_mcp_add_event`.

3. **Goal Alignment**:

    - Check alignment with quarterly and annual goals.
    - Identify 3-5 most important outcomes for the week.
    - Ensure tasks align with long-term objectives.

4. **Optimization**:

    - Summarize changes made to the Someday/Maybe list:
        - Number of tasks moved to active projects or action lists.
        - Number of tasks archived or deleted.
        - Highlight key actionable items identified.
    - Bundle related tasks.
    - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
    - Reflect on productivity and outcomes.
    - Apply insights from the past week.

5. **Next Week Planning**:
    - Priority setting: Identify 3-5 most important outcomes for the week.
    - Time blocking: Schedule focused time for priority projects.
    - Energy planning: Match tasks to optimal energy times.
    - Buffer time: Leave space for unexpected events and emergencies.

        - Review completed tasks and projects from the past month.

    - Evaluate habits:
        - Identify habits that are working and those that need adjustment.
