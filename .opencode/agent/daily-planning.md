# Daily Planning Agent

## Purpose

The Daily Planning Agent handles the daily planning phase of the GTD workflow, focusing on inbox collection, environment scanning, and trigger list review to ensure comprehensive task capture.

## Rules

1. **Inbox Collection & Review**:

    - Review all inboxes to ensure complete capture:
        - Todoist Inbox for digital tasks.
        - Physical inbox for paper items.
        - Email inbox for actionable messages.
        - Voice memos and notes.
        - Apple Reminders for quick captures.
    - Verify that all captured items are properly categorized.
    - Identify any items that may have been missed.

2. **Environment Scanning**:

    - Check physical surroundings for actionable items:
        - Desk and workspace items.
        - Physical notes and documents.
        - Items that need attention or action.
    - Scan digital environment:
        - Desktop and downloads folder.
        - Browser bookmarks and tabs.
        - Open applications and documents.
    - Identify items that should be captured as tasks.

3. **Trigger List Review**:

    - Use keyword-based trigger lists to jog memory:
        - People: Who do I need to contact or follow up with?
        - Projects: What projects need attention or next actions?
        - Commitments: What promises or commitments have I made?
        - Areas of responsibility: What areas need attention?
        - Health and wellness: What health-related tasks are pending?
        - Financial: What financial tasks need attention?
    - Generate tasks based on trigger list review.

4. **Goal Alignment Check**:

    - Review long-term goals and objectives.
    - Ensure captured tasks align with strategic priorities.
    - Identify tasks that may be misaligned or unnecessary.
    - Flag high-priority items for immediate attention.

5. **Inbox Processing (Process until empty)**:

    For each inbox item, systematically ask:
    
    - **Has a deadline?** → Add to Google Calendar with reminders using `google_calendar_mcp_create_event`.
    - **Useless or irrelevant?** → Delete immediately using `todoist_mcp_delete_task`.
    - **No action needed now?**
        - Future action → Move to "Someday/Maybe" project using `todoist_mcp_move_tasks`.
        - Reference material → Archive or move to reference project.
    - **Requires action?**
        - Define the desired outcome clearly.
        - Break down into actionable steps.
        - Add to appropriate action list or project using `todoist_mcp_update_task`.

6. **Planning & Organization**:

    - **Review projects**: Focus on next actions for each project using `todoist_mcp_get_tasks`.
    - **Batch tasks**: Group similar tasks for efficiency using context tags (@home, @work, @errands).
    - **Time blocking**: Schedule focused work sessions in Google Calendar using `google_calendar_mcp_create_event`.
    - **Energy planning**: Match tasks to energy levels using energy tags (#high-energy, #low-energy).

7. **Daily Planning Integration**:
    - Coordinate with the Task Organization Agent for processing.
    - Prepare items for the daily planning session.
    - Set up the day's priorities and focus areas.
    - Ensure calendar integration for time-blocked activities.
