# How to Use Your GTD System with opencode

## Overview

Your GTD system is integrated with opencode, providing two specialized modes and AI-powered agents for complete workflow automation. The system uses a Master Agent to orchestrate specialized agents for different phases of Getting Things Done.

## opencode Setup

### 1. Switch to GTD Mode
opencode has two GTD-optimized modes:

**GTD Mode (Full System):**
- Press `Tab` key to switch modes, select "gtd"
- Full GTD Master Agent with all tools enabled
- Complete workflow support with task management

**Plan Mode (Read-only):**

- Perfect for reviewing and planning without making changes

### 2. System Setup (One-time)
After switching to GTD mode, initialize your system:
```
"Initialize my GTD system"
```
This creates your system context storage and sets up default preferences.

### 3. Basic Commands

**Capture anything instantly:**
```
"Capture: Call John about project update"
"Add task: Buy groceries on Friday"
"Remember: Schedule dentist appointment"
```

**Daily Planning (15-20 minutes):**
```
"Plan my day"
"Help me process my inbox"

"Something urgent came up: call client about deadline"
```

## The 4 GTD Phases

### Phase 0: Capture (5 seconds)
**When to use:** Anytime you have a thought, idea, or task
**Commands:**
- `"Capture: [your task/idea]"`
- `"Add to inbox: [item]"`
- `"Remember: [thought]"`

The system automatically captures from emails, calendar events, and reminders too.

### Phase 1: Daily Planning (15-20 minutes, end of day)
**When to use:** End of each workday
**Commands:**
- `"Plan my day"` - Full daily planning sequence
- `"Process my inbox"` - Just inbox processing
- `"Review my environment"` - Scan for missed items

The Master Agent will guide you through:
1. Inbox collection & review
2. Environment scanning  
3. Trigger list review
4. Inbox processing (until empty)
5. Planning & time blocking

### Phase 2: Execution (Throughout the day)
**When to use:** When you're ready to work
**Commands:**
- `"What should I work on?"` - Get task recommendations
- `"I'm at [location] with [time] available"` - Context-aware suggestions
- `"Start working on [task]"` - Begin focused execution
- `"Quick capture: [interruption]"` - Capture without losing focus

### Phase 3: Review (Weekly - 30 minutes)
**When to use:** Every Sunday
**Commands:**
- `"Start weekly review"` - Full weekly review
- `"Review my progress this week"` - Progress summary
- `"Plan next week"` - Next week planning

## Smart Features

### Context-Aware Suggestions
The system learns your patterns and provides intelligent recommendations:
```
"I have 45 minutes before my meeting"
→ Suggests quick, context-appropriate tasks

"It's Monday morning and I'm feeling energetic"
→ Recommends high-energy, important work
```

### Automatic Integration
- **Calendar sync:** Tasks with deadlines automatically become calendar events
- **Time blocking:** Important work gets scheduled in your calendar
- **Smart capture:** Emails and meetings automatically generate tasks

### Energy & Context Matching
Tell the system about your preferences:
```
"I'm most productive from 9-11am for deep work"
"Tag errands with @errands and home tasks with @home"
"I prefer 2-hour blocks for creative work"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Trust the capture:** Don't worry about organizing - just capture everything instantly
2. **Process to zero:** During daily planning, get your inbox completely empty
3. **One thing at a time:** Use the execution agent to maintain focus
4. **Weekly reviews are crucial:** Don't skip them - they keep the whole system working
5. **Let it learn:** The more you use it, the better recommendations become

## Example Daily Flow

**Morning (2 minutes):**
```
"What should I work on? I have 3 hours for deep work"
```

**During work:**
```
"Start working on quarterly report"
[Later] "Quick capture: follow up with Sarah about budget"
```

**End of day (15 minutes):**
```
"Plan tomorrow" 
```

**Sunday (30 minutes):**
```
"Start weekly review"
```

## Troubleshooting

**"My inbox is overwhelming":** 
- Start with: `"Help me process my inbox step by step"`

**"I don't know what to work on":**
- Try: `"What should I work on? I'm [location] with [time] and feeling [energy level]"`

**"I keep forgetting to review":**
- Set a calendar reminder for Sunday evenings and use: `"Start weekly review"`
