## 🎯 Overview

This is my personal implementation of David Allen's GTD methodology, specifically designed around the Things app with intelligent agents to automate workflow management. **While I use Things 3, you can adapt this system to work with any todo list app** by replacing the MCP server and updating the agent instructions.

The system focuses on:

-   **Instant capture** - Everything goes to Things Inbox first (Ctrl+Space)
-   **Daily planning** - Inbox to zero using Things native Today/Upcoming/Anytime/Someday
-   **Focused execution** - Today/Anytime focus with Quick Find context switching
-   **Weekly reviews** - Areas/Projects maintenance for sustainable productivity

> **📖 See It In Action**: Want to see how this actually works? Check out [A Day with My GTD System.md](A%20Day%20with%20My%20GTD%20System.md) - a complete walkthrough from 6 AM wake-up to 10 PM completion, showing how the system handles real interruptions, context switching, and maintains focus throughout a typical day!

## 🎪 Key Features

-   **Things-native scheduling** - Leverages Today/Upcoming/Anytime/Someday naturally
-   **Calendar integration** - Seamless appointment + task coordination
-   **Minimal tagging** - Only tag what you actually search for
-   **Energy-based execution** - Match tasks to current energy levels
-   **Instant capture** - Never lose ideas with Ctrl+Space integration
-   **AI-powered workflow** - Intelligent agents guide each GTD phase

## 🤖 Intelligent Agents

Built with [opencode](https://opencode.ai) using a unified GTD Master Agent that orchestrates specialized workflow components:

-   **GTD Master Agent** - Unified orchestrator with intelligent routing and automation framework
-   **Daily Planning Agent** - Interactive inbox processing with guided decision-making
-   **Execution Agent** - Context-aware task selection and execution guidance  
-   **Review Phase Agent** - Strategic system maintenance through guided reviews

The system uses **natural language processing** with automatic delegation to specialized workflow phases. No mode switching required - just describe what you want to accomplish and the system routes to the appropriate workflow automation.

## 📋 Requirements

-   **Things 3** (macOS/iOS) - _Or any todo list app with MCP integration_
-   **Google Calendar** access
-   **opencode** development environment
-   **MCP servers** for your chosen todo app and Google Calendar integration

> **💡 Using a Different Todo App?**  
> This system is built for Things 3, but you can adapt it to work with any todo list app:
>
> 1. Replace the Things MCP server with one for your preferred app (Todoist, Notion, etc.)
> 2. Update the agent instructions in `.opencode/agent/` files to match your app's terminology and workflow
> 3. Modify the `opencode.json` configuration to use your new MCP server
>
> The core GTD principles and agent workflow remain the same!

## ⚠️ Important Warning

**AI systems can make mistakes!** This system has direct access to your Tasks and Calendar data. The AI agents may:

-   Accidentally delete or modify tasks
-   Move tasks to wrong lists or dates
-   Create duplicate entries
-   Mess up calendar events or scheduling

**Recommendations:**

-   **Test with non-critical data first** - Use a separate Things database or test calendar
-   **Start slowly** - Begin with read-only commands before letting AI modify your data
-   **Backup regularly** - Export your Things data and sync calendar to multiple accounts
-   **Review AI actions** - Always verify what the AI did, especially for important tasks
-   **Use at your own risk** - This is experimental software for personal use

**For beginners:** Consider starting in "read-only" mode by disabling write permissions in the agent configurations until you're comfortable with the system's behavior.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Open opencode in the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/my-gtd-buddy
    opencode
    ```

2. **Start using the GTD system with natural language:**

    ```
    # The system automatically routes to appropriate workflow phases
    Plan my day                    # → Daily Planning Workflow
    Add task: Call dentist tomorrow # → Built-in Capture
    What should I work on next?    # → Execution Workflow
    Start weekly review           # → Review Phase Workflow
    ```

3. **No mode switching required** - the GTD Master Agent intelligently routes your requests to specialized workflow phases based on your intent.

### Quick Start Commands

Interact with your GTD system using natural language - the system automatically routes to the right workflow:

```
# Daily planning (routes to Planning Workflow)
Plan my day
Process my inbox
Help me organize tasks

# Built-in capture
Add task: Research new productivity tools
Remember to prep for meeting
Capture: Buy groceries

# Task execution (routes to Execution Workflow)
What should I work on next?
Show me high-energy tasks
I need a quick task before lunch

# System maintenance (routes to Review Workflow)
Start weekly review
