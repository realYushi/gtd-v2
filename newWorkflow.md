## 1. Daily Planning Phase (Morning - 10 minutes) - Things Native

### 1.1 Inbox Processing (Things Way)

Open Things Inbox and for each item ask:

1. **Is it actionable?** 
   - No → Delete, Someday, or Reference
   - Yes → Continue
2. **What's the desired outcome?** Define success clearly
3. **What's the next physical action?** Be specific
4. **When will I start this?**
   - Today → Move to Today list
   - This week → Schedule in Upcoming  
   - Someday → Move to Anytime or Someday
   - Deadline → Set due date, appears in Upcoming

### 1.2 Things Native Scheduling

- **Today**: What I want to start before day ends
- **Upcoming**: Timeline view - scheduled dates and deadlines  
- **Anytime**: Tasks I could start anytime (good for planning)
- **Someday**: Things I might do but not sure when

### 1.3 Daily Organization

- **Review calendar in Things** (enable in Settings)
- **Plan energy**: Match Today tasks to energy levels
